                        James Baldwin defines the safe remove as the “effort to keep the audience [distanced] from the experience which films are not really prepared to convey.”[1] Both America and the film industry are affected by this safe remove, since they are both deeply intertwined with matters of race and representation. Anything that is too risky to say to an audience dominated by white people is often not spoken about or shown, in order to shy away from controversy and trouble. The safe remove in America is represented by “the distance between White America and Black America,” but as Baldwin asks, “who established this distance, who is this distance designed to protect, and from what is this distance designed to offer protection?”[2] In most cases the distance is established by White America to protect White America from Black America. This can be interpreted as protecting White America from the truth of its violent and exploitational history towards Black America. These questions can be asked more deeply in terms of the specific area of remove that is being dealt with in film and America. In terms of the remove between the black woman and White America, much can be said about how the black woman is disrespected by America. Her body is objectified, and her intelligence is diminished by this continuous cycle of oppression. The film industry does its part by removing the sexual intimacy of the black woman from White America and mainstream media, by exorcizing the blackness and femininity of the black woman and her capacity for romantic, sexual pleasure. This distance created by the film industry protects White America from the idea that the black woman can be more than a sexual object at the hands of the white man.
