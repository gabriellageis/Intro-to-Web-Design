                    There are some films that do the Black Woman justice in terms of the respect shown towards her and her body relating to sexual matters. In the film adaptation of James Baldwin’s novel If Beale Street Could Talk, there is a scene depicting the main characters Fonny and Tish making love.[1] It is a sex scene between two young black people, which is not common to find in many movies. In addition, it boldly presents its subjects in a bare, stripped of stereotypes version of themselves reflecting a reality that does not conform to society’s ideas about how the black man and woman make love. Instead of portraying the black man to be what America considers a “personal, emotional, sexual, psychological threat for an American,” Fonny is portrayed as a gentle, calm lover.[2] The black woman, Tish, is portrayed as cautious to take her clothes off and her body is covered by a blanket, so as not to allow the camera and the audience to take advantage of her body, the black woman’s body. Nervousness is shown in her eyes, yet not the typical look of fear shown in the eyes of a black woman on screen when she is being taken advantage of. The nervousness represents her lack of experience sexually speaking, and perhaps could be interpreted as her lack of experience being shown in this respectful, authentic way on screen. In this movie, and in this scene, all of the pieces are arranged in perfect order to boldly allow the viewer to enter a world that cinema has long kept shut and chosen not to represent. In this scene the movie itself pauses in a sense to allow the audience to observe, but not interrupt, the intimate moment between the couple. The soundtrack is turned off, as well as the lights in the scene, so that nothing interferes. The scene begins shot from Tish’s view of Fonny, before focusing on the couple together, then drifting off to a shot of the record player in order to let the couple enjoy their intimate moment together. This allows the black woman to be the star of the scene in a different interpretation of the word. Her body is not on display for the joy of the audience or even her partner in the film. She is covered and allowed her space on film to bask in the intimacy and pleasure of the moment. This is the black woman making love. She is more than something that the white man runs to to pleasure himself when he is bored of his wife. She doesn’t have to reveal her body in order to be loved. She can be appreciated, and she can be the center of attention in the moment on film.

                <h2>Removing "The Safe Remove"</h2>
                <p>
                    Showing appreciation to the black woman is intimidating to the film industry, who has only chosen to exhibit her as someone else’s object to be used. By presenting Tish with her blackness fully intact, a new path has been paved exemplifying how black characters and black love should be portrayed in the future in order to correctly convey the emotions and intricacies of the black woman. It is not necessary to display the black woman in the same old role that has been crafted to subdue the angst of change for the white audience when it comes to the sexual being that is the black woman. Traditionally, film has found “a lie more palatable than the truth” in the characters that black actors play and the stories that films casting them tell.[3] Their characters either have the characteristics of a white person, or are the white person’s idea of what a stereotypical black person is. Their storyline is built to make them bow down to the powerful white man who will only proceed to take advantage of the black woman the first chance he gets. This story is old, it is safe, and it is tiring. The distance between White America and Black America needs to be removed in real life and in film, and this can partially be achieved by respecting the black woman and making sure that the stories told about her accurately portray the complete picture of her as an individual. In the future of film, the black woman should be represented fairly and truthfully with intricate new storylines that give her the power to reclaim her body, her sexuality, and herself, because there is a whole lotta black woman that has yet to be explored on screen.
