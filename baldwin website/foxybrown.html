                    In the film Foxy Brown, the title character is described as “a whole lotta woman.” [1] But what is the definition of a woman, and a black woman specifically? By the look of the film, it seems that being “a whole lotta woman” only has to do with one’s physical appearance. Foxy Brown is a beautiful woman: well sculpted and the object of men’s attention. The film makes sure that you know this from the very beginning of the title credits where she is shown dancing around seductively in her lingerie. The first scene where the audience is introduced to Foxy is hypersexualized as well, offering from the very beginning a sense of scopophilia. The audience receives the pleasure of watching as she gets out of bed wearing a sheer nightgown. She then proceeds to take it off right in front of the camera showing her naked body; her entire body except for her head which is out of the frame. The scene is supposed to be about how Foxy is running off quickly to save her brother from trouble. It should show the empowerment of the woman as she is going to save the helpless man. Yet instead the details are rearranged, and it shows her as all she is throughout the entire movie: a sexual object whose only important features are her body. She does not even need her head in the shot, signifying that her brain is of no important use towards her character. While Foxy Brown is rushing off to support and save the man in the film, she first stops to pleasure the man in the audience by putting her body on display.

                    The man in the audience does not feel intimidated by Foxy when she is shown with her head out of the camera shot. The male characters and viewers do not take her seriously, because by showing her as a body without a head, they are showing a “reality by which they are not threatened.”[2] They are not threatened because this woman cannot cause any harm to them if she does not have the capacity to do so. This idea of harm would be fueled by brain power, which the film is obviously insinuating that she lacks by removing her head. She can show her body, but when it comes to any substantial action beyond that, she is always subdued by the white man in the film. Whenever Foxy tries to fight against the white men in charge of the prostitutes, she always ends up beaten up and tied down. This brings reassurance to the white man in the audience that when they are “on the other side of town with all the black girls you can find,” they are completely safe.[3] They are untouchable, because on film the white man is always shown in the position of power and dominance, especially when it comes to the black woman. Showing the black woman on film with only her body in the shot enforces her as a “look, pleasurable in form,” but removes the “threatening in content” aspect.[4] There is neither content, nor a voice, if she is simply a body on display.

                    Throughout the entire film, the idea that this woman has an existence outside of the viewing pleasure of the male is completely unrealized. When Foxy is going to get ready for her first night working as a high-end prostitute, every guy in the organization that she walks past breaks their neck to watch her curvy figure walk by. Since she will be entertaining white men for the evening, Foxy has conformed to a whitened version of herself. She follows the same techniques that Baldwin accuses Harriet Beecher Stowe of using to craft her characters in Uncle Tom’s Cabin, of being “in all other respects [than skin color], as white as she can make [herself].”[5] This exemplifies the safe remove in the idea that the black woman cannot be herself, and her blackness must be exorcized. White America has a “fear of the dark,” meaning that the white characters in the film and the white audience are not ready and prepared to accept a confident, natural black woman as sexually attractive.[6] Instead her looks must show that she is aspiring to be a white woman and covering up all of the aspects of herself that make her black. It is either through this metaphorical change in skin color or complete humility that the black woman can be accepted into the film.
