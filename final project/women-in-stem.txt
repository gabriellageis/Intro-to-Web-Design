My website is about the importance of Women in STEM. This is a social cause that I strongly believe in and it is what I have shaped my concentration in Gallatin around. I want this website to serve as a space of learning about women in stem and why it is an important issue. I also want it to serve as a resource for both young women in high school and at NYU. This is why I have a section dedicated to both of these groups of women. For the high school students, I have pooled together a list of extracurricular resources that are open to young women in high school, and linked to their pages for more information about summer programs that they offer. For the women at NYU, I have described programs at both NYU CAS and Tandon, and I have created a list of clubs that are available in multiple schools at NYU. I want to make this website a resource to all, so it is important to me to show opportunities for a wide range of women, as well as to provide information to anyone who is interested in the topic.
