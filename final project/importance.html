                    Why aren't there more women going into STEM fields? Men continue to outnumber women when it comes to pursuing education and careers in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics fields. This has been the case since these fields were established. This gender disparity has been brought up by many who believe that women should be pushed towards these fields and that they should be advertised to them. Creating this mindset that women are as capable in STEM careers as men starts at a young age. Beginning during time spent in elementary school, all children regardless of gender should be pushed towards these technical fields. This means encouraging every student to try hard in their science and math classes. When students enter middle and high school,they should all be pushed towards trying out computer science and engineering courses that are offered. If they have the chance to take these classes early on, they will be able to see if it is something that they enjoy and want to pursue. There are also other extracurricular options that young women in particular should be notified about. These include programs that Girls Who Code, Kode With Klossy, and iD Tech Camps offer. By participating in these programs, young women can get more comfortable working with these STEM subjects, while also bonding together in the uplifting atmosphere of an all women classroom.
